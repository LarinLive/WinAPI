	/// To retrieve a device handle, use the <see cref="CreateFile"/> function.</param>
	/// <param name="dwIoControlCode">The control code for the operation. This value identifies the specific operation to be performed and the type of device on which to perform it.</param>
	/// <param name="lpInBuffer">A pointer to the input buffer that contains the data required to perform the operation. The format of this data depends on the value of the dwIoControlCode parameter.
	/// This parameter can be NULL if dwIoControlCode specifies an operation that does not require input data.</param>
	/// <param name="nInBufferSize">The size of the input buffer, in bytes.</param>
	/// <param name="lpOutBuffer">A pointer to the output buffer that is to receive the data returned by the operation. The format of this data depends on the value of the dwIoControlCode parameter.
	/// This parameter can be NULL if dwIoControlCode specifies an operation that does not return data.</param>
	/// <param name="nOutBufferSize">The size of the output buffer, in bytes.</param>
	/// <param name="lpBytesReturned">A pointer to a variable that receives the size of the data stored in the output buffer, in bytes.</param>
	/// <param name="lpOverlapped">A pointer to an <see cref="OVERLAPPED"/> structure. If hDevice was opened without specifying <see cref="FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED"/>, lpOverlapped is ignored.
	/// If hDevice was opened with the <see cref="FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED"/> flag, the operation is performed as an overlapped(asynchronous) operation.
	/// In this case, lpOverlapped must point to a valid <see cref="OVERLAPPED"/> structure that contains a handle to an event object. Otherwise, the function fails in unpredictable ways.
	/// For overlapped operations, <see cref="DeviceIoControl"/> returns immediately, and the event object is signaled when the operation has been completed. 
	/// Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.</param>
