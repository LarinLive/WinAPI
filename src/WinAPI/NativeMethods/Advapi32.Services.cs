	/// <param name="lpBinaryPathName">The fully qualified path to the service binary file. Specify NULL if you are not changing the existing path. 
	/// If the path contains a space, it must be quoted so that it is correctly interpreted. For example, "d:\my share\myservice.exe" should be specified as ""d:\my share\myservice.exe"".
	/// The path can also include arguments for an auto-start service. These arguments are passed to the service entry point (typically the main function).</param>

	/// If the service type is <see cref="SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS"/>, use an account name in the form DomainName\UserName. The service process will be logged on as this user.

	/// <param name="lpPassword">The password to the account name specified by the lpServiceStartName parameter. Specify NULL if you are not changing the existing password. 
	/// Specify an empty string if the account has no password or if the service runs in the LocalService, NetworkService, or LocalSystem account. </param>
